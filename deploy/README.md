# Deploying ScorpioFS

This directory and the repo-root artifacts (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`,
`install.sh`) cover the supported deployment paths. ScorpioFS mounts a FUSE
filesystem, so **every** path needs a FUSE-capable host.

## FUSE prerequisites (read first)

ScorpioFS cannot run where FUSE is unavailable. On the host (or container) you
need:

- the `fuse` kernel module loaded and the `/dev/fuse` device present;
- the `fuse3` userspace package (provides the setuid `fusermount3` helper);
- permission to mount — either `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, or unprivileged mounting via
  `fusermount3` (the `rfuse3` `unprivileged` feature is enabled in this build).

Run `scorpio doctor` to check these on a given host.

> Not every environment can run FUSE (many managed/rootless container platforms
> block `/dev/fuse` or `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`). There is no workaround — pick a host
> that allows it.

## ⚠️ The HTTP API is unauthenticated

`/api/fs/*`, `/api/config`, `/antares/*`, and `/health` have **no authentication**.
Anyone who can reach the port can trigger mounts/unmounts. Therefore:

- The systemd unit and the compose example bind the HTTP port to **loopback
  (`127.0.0.1`)** by default.
- The code default (`scorpio serve`) is still `0.0.0.0:2725`; only change the
  deployment to a routable address when it sits behind a **firewall and/or an
  authenticating reverse proxy**.
- Never expose port 2725/2726 directly to an untrusted network.

## Container (Docker / Compose)

```bash
docker build -t scorpiofs .

docker run --rm \
  --device /dev/fuse \
  --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  --security-opt apparmor:unconfined \
  -e SCORPIO_BASE_URL=http://your-mega:8000 \
  -e SCORPIO_LFS_URL=http://your-mega:8000/lfs \
  -p 127.0.0.1:2725:2725 \
  scorpiofs
```

`SCORPIO_BASE_URL` and `SCORPIO_LFS_URL` are **required** for `serve`; the
container entrypoint refuses to start without them (so it never silently points
at localhost).

`docker compose up` brings up ScorpioFS plus a `mega` backend; **set the `mega`
image** in `docker-compose.yml` to the one you run (the default tag is a
placeholder). Configuration is entirely env-driven (`SCORPIO_*`); no developer
paths are baked into the image. The image ships a `HEALTHCHECK` against
`GET /health`.

### Security notes (containers)

- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is broad. Grant it only to this workload, and prefer a
  dedicated, otherwise-unprivileged container.
- `--security-opt apparmor:unconfined` is often required for FUSE mount
  propagation; scope it tightly.
- The reverse proxy (if any) only needs the HTTP port — the FUSE mount lives
  inside the container and cannot be proxied over HTTP.

## systemd (bare metal)

Unit files live in [`systemd/`](./systemd/). Typical install:

```bash
sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --user-group scorpiofs
sudo usermod -aG fuse scorpiofs
sudo install -D -m0644 deploy/systemd/scorpiofs.service /etc/systemd/system/scorpiofs.service

# Install a config whose paths match the unit's /var/lib/scorpiofs tree. Do NOT
# just copy scorpio.toml.example — its /tmp paths and relative config_file are
# for local dev, and the service (User=scorpiofs, no WorkingDirectory) would
# write state relative to `/`, failing with permission denied.
sudo install -d /etc/scorpiofs
sudo tee /etc/scorpiofs/scorpio.toml >/dev/null <<'EOF'
base_url = "http://your-mega:8000"
lfs_url = "http://your-mega:8000/lfs"
workspace = "/var/lib/scorpiofs/mount"
store_path = "/var/lib/scorpiofs/store"
config_file = "/var/lib/scorpiofs/config.toml"
git_author = "MEGA"
git_email = "admin@mega.org"
log_level = "info"
antares_upper_root = "/var/lib/scorpiofs/antares/upper"
antares_cl_root = "/var/lib/scorpiofs/antares/cl"
antares_mount_root = "/var/lib/scorpiofs/antares/mnt"
antares_state_file = "/var/lib/scorpiofs/antares/state.toml"
EOF
sudo "${EDITOR:-vi}" /etc/scorpiofs/scorpio.toml   # set base_url / lfs_url

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now scorpiofs
systemctl status scorpiofs
```

(`install.sh` already generates a `/var/lib/scorpiofs`-based config for you, so
if you used it you can skip the config step above and just edit `base_url`/`lfs_url`.)

The unit uses `Type=simple` with `/health` as the external readiness probe
(`Type=notify` is intentionally **not** used — the daemon does not implement
`sd_notify`). `TimeoutStopSec=45` exceeds the in-process shutdown budget
(daemon join 20s + Antares cleanup 15s) so graceful unmount completes before
`SIGKILL`. `Restart=on-failure` with `StartLimitBurst` rate-limiting handles
crashes; `ExecStopPost` lazily unmounts any residual mountpoint.

### Capabilities vs setuid

- **`AmbientCapabilities=CAP_SYS_ADMIN`** (used by the unit): the service user
  gets the mount capability without running as root. High privilege — review
  before enabling.
- **setuid `fusermount3`**: the `fuse3` package's helper is setuid root and can
  perform unprivileged mounts. If your environment allows it, you can drop
  `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and rely on `fusermount3` instead. Verify with `scorpio doctor`.
- This is FUSE (libfuse-fs userspace OverlayFs), **not** kernel `overlayfs`; do
  not try to `mount -t overlay` these paths.

## install.sh

`install.sh` downloads a release tarball, **verifies its SHA256 checksum**, and
installs `scorpio`/`antares` plus a generated `/etc/scorpiofs/scorpio.toml`.

- Always supports `--dry-run` to preview every action.
- It never modifies `/etc/fuse.conf` unless you pass `--enable-user-allow-other`.
- System packages are installed via apt/dnf/pacman (skip with `--no-deps`).
- `--uninstall` removes the binaries and leaves config/data in place.

```bash
bash install.sh --version v0.3.0 --dry-run   # preview
sudo bash install.sh --version v0.3.0        # install
```

## Releases & supply chain

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which:

- builds `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (and best-effort `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`
  via `cross`; a failure there does not block the x86_64 release);
- packages each target as `scorpiofs-<version>-<target>.tar.gz` containing
  `scorpio`, `antares`, `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE`, and `README.md`;
- generates a `<tarball>.sha256` per artifact plus a combined `SHA256SUMS`;
- creates a GitHub Release with all artifacts attached.

`install.sh` downloads the per-target tarball **and its `.sha256`**, then runs
`sha256sum -c` and refuses to install on mismatch.

Publishing to **crates.io is decoupled** from the binary release: the
`publish-crate` job targets a protected GitHub Environment (`crates-io`).
Configure a required reviewer on that environment so an ordinary tag push cannot
publish the crate without manual approval, and store `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as an
environment secret (least privilege).

This project is dual-licensed under MIT (`LICENSE-MIT`) OR Apache-2.0
(`LICENSE-APACHE`).
